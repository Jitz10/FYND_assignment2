RBiiGw8c7j-0a8nk35JO3w,2010-12-22,z6y3GRpYDqTznVe-0dn--Q,1,"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

LWtoosGlzTOp8A73Jh7cQw,2010-11-08,1FLzfSSQMNekqAaMC0jyOA,4,"There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations.

First off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')

Fry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.

Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.

Not all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.

One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.

Oh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.",review,mbgppRfYH0kC7p7X2VPcGg,0,0,0,4.0,"The review is largely positive, highlighting convenient hours, good selection, competitive prices, and a well-kept parking lot.

I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.

The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.

The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well.

m5i2s4k994c8QumJPRNjGw,2007-11-29,SYK_LgV8wDoezdu9acfz2w,1,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his ""wild mushroom"" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so ""wild"" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling.

PoRYjYUSjmeWM1WLsx_45w,2007-10-23,6b5sifuzXWw0cMd_8c9how,3,"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement.

YEQkTCmphjr6XKPh4m93AQ,2010-11-29,mSaa0X25WDBQYj5faxX1zw,4,"While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.

The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.

u-nMW__EKMYH_PVqacYc3Q,2012-09-17,KiMfNA05aF5x_Zq2iu4H_A,4,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!).",review,imb8zI2mPdiXSXeRuVntag,1,3,1,4.0,"The reviewer highlights several standout dishes and overall positive experience, but notes slow service and some basic menu items.

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!

When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!

In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.

Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.

I'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was ""too tired"" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where's the ""puff?,"" I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don't misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D

Last, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa.

I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all.

As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless.

There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things.

Today, I get a phone call at 4pm, saying she is picking me up to go get those damn cupcakes. She was serious! Since I had off and she got off early, we were able to visit the holy mecca of cupcake land. She picked me up in what may be one of the most ridiculous blue convertables known to man and we zoomed up to Scottsdale, blasting bad hip hop, psyched about individual iced cakes!

Upon arrival, the space was sparse and very IKEA-ish. Pinks and lime greens dominate the palate. To the right of the counter was t-shirts, rubber duckies and other merch. They do have a brown with orange stripes guy shirt...in XL. I guess big men love cupcakes!

But the real star are the cupcakes themselves...lovingly displayed under glass domes. Carrot cakes, german chocolate cake, mocha chocolate cake, blonde (vanilla on vanilla), chocolate on vanilla, and the special of the day key lime....oh man. MERCY. I kept dodging between the carrot and the mocha and went for the Mocha. All natural ingrediants and VEGAN sprinkles! (But very much all dairy icings, btw). Our lady, I think Melissa, was super helpful and even offered samplings of cupcakes to help us decide. She put each individual cupcake in a plastic bubble and in a cute lime green/pink dotted bag. She noted they do have mini cupcakes for events (OMG) and I would totally splurge for those suckers. 

The only real negative (besides times..I mean if this place was open late, it would be HEAVEN) was the lack of drink choices. Coffee, milk or water. Um..I mean, I dont knew a bazillion options, but even tea would have been nice. I chose hot coffee which was fine. But iced coffee as an option would have been kick ass...or lime rickeys! OMG!

As an FYI, you can leave the strip mall complex and head down to the park and eat your delectables under  a shaded tree on a park bench over looking a ""pond"" like we did. I savoured my 2.95 cupcake, and the icing and cake was perfect. I cant even describe how yummy it was. It was worth every cent.

There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets I've seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.

The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg.

I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.

We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.

I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:

1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!

2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.

Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free!

Meal:  We both had sandwiches and a side of the mac and cheese.  I can't remember what local beers we had, but they were excellent.  They have a terrific beer selection.

Taste:  There were many, many delicious choices on the menu and sadly, the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu.  Its still good, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  7 out of 10.

Value: I thought the prices and potions were very and reasonable, but the real value is in their happy hour specials. 4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Our server was very attentive, silly and friendly.  Her recommendation for craft beer was dead on.  9 out of 10.

I have had their tacos and enchiladas and prefer Arriba's (right next door) or Carlos O'briens, just down the street. There is even some mom and pop place by my apartments that equates to the quality and taste. 

What I like about Los Olivos is their Nachos. OMG this thing is huge. Imagine a large pizza in your head and then replace that image with the same size plate of nachos. I am not even kidding. Four or more people could munch on this. They do it exactly how I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. YUM 

That is what has been keeping me coming back, but after the other night I feel I am sure to find somewhere whose nachos make me just as happy. 

Every time I have been here, it has been dead. And last time I came at prime dinner time. Then why is the service so awful? This kid kept coming up to our table and trying to take things. We weren't even half way done with our nachos when he asked while I'm in MID BITE ""are you finished with that"" not only asking but reaching his hand to grab the plate! And this happened repeatedly as we tried to finish our food. I don't know if they wanted us out of there or what. And then for someone who was so ""attentive"" I waited for 5-10 minutes for a drink refill (make the glasses clear and it won't be so hard to tell if I need more)

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!

I came here w/ a friend on a first friday, she was DD'ing and i was her passenger ""and i ride and i ride i ride through the city's backside.."" until we eventually reached E and desperatly needed petrol. Like a suspicious siren this little green long necked demon sang to us, luring us in w/ his dino siren song. As we pulled in a car was broken down near the entrance and several dudes were milling around the engine, hood propped open, pondering their next move. I grimaced at their misfortune. We filled up, i strolled inside to pay for my friend Kathy's gas and get some munchies. I walk back out to her car and pump her gas, we chat and make jokes. All the while i notice Kathy is so sketched out, ( a case of white girl from the burbs out of her comfort zone late at night down town).
Gas pumped check. We climb back in, she turns the key in the ignition, and dead silence. A mere clicking and then nothing. SSSHHHIIIIIIITTTT.
she starts panicking, i can only help but laugh at our misfortune. Two cars in the same gas station broken down.
Our situation only seemed more dire as time passed, and each car that came to Sinclair refused to help us, or just shirked us off w/ some lame excuse.
It was only until two young mexican teenagers came to our rescue that we were able to move. the other car had managed to start up, and the boys asked the men in spanish if they could give us a jump, reluctantly they agreed. The Mexican men swung their beater over towards Kathy's engine and we hooked up the cables and...LIFE!
we said our thank yous and shook hands, and then brought the teens back to their homes, much to the protest of my scared white girl associate.

The only downside is that Kimpton hasn't fully finished up on the room makeovers yet. Compared with Kimpton's usual attention to room furnishings and design, these digs are mild-mannered. The older patterned carpeting was disappointing.

Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.

Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.  

Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.

The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!

As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in ""Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?""), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) 

Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that ""Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist."" Now I feel better. 

There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.

It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny.

I've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I don't care as long as I get good service.  We're not family, I don't need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).

Moreover, the prices are amazing!

In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce. This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon. They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while.

If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of ""like 3 items""  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time..",review,IVb9YMopuGyt5jJ7rjwoqg,0,0,0,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the menu variety, affordability, and food quality, with no complaints.

AeoJkr_dlNshB078OepP8w,2010-03-02,FubrebQ3LpIG9UFBC7DtFg,3,"The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.",review,FktbKOzznpoKTNXMVtc8EA,1,1,0,,Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0),,"Error: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for model `openai/gpt-oss-20b` in organization `org_01jmgtj24gf79srbwzt7zb1wre` service tier `on_demand` on tokens per day (TPD): Limit 200000, Used 199410, Requested 1040.

z3yFuLVrmH-3RJruPEMYKw,2010-04-24,7iUIThqzcZwOi7Xtu0C1jg,5,"When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  

First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  

My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.

It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!",review,wHg1YkCzdZq9WBJOTRgxHQ,6,7,5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the food, variety, and overall experience.
